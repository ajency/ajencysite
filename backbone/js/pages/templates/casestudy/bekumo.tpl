                Enterprise mobility and within it BYOD is one of the hottest sectors right now. We are absolutely thrilled to work with a team of two Vodafone Veterans who came together to build something in this space. The product prototype was built to gauge and garner
                investor + customer interest. The product went to the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and is currently being demoed with prospective clients in London and showcased to Venture firms.

            <p>
                Bekumo web interface is essentially a tool for the IT managers to provision apps and manage users. Given the legacy software used by IT Managers our benchmarks for the user interface needed were not very high. We undertood early on the importance of that
                one "Wow" moment in customer demos and built the user and app management console as a drag and drop interface. In the limited customer demos that have been done their eyes lit up every single time they could drag an app from available
                pool to a user and see it pop up on that user's iPad or his Nexus phone.

            <h1>Truly Cross Platform</h1>

            <p>
                Coss platform is something that most products consider at a much later stage in their product life cycle. However for the success of Bekumo it was important that we build the prototype to work on the browser and have apps for iOS and Android. HTML5 was
                explored and removed from the consideration set. We decided to build the apps in Appcelerator Titanium as it does a native build and still offers a Javascript based development library. The app was designed and built for tablets, phones
                across both iOS and Android.

                It has become customary to have good reporting tools and visual representation of data in both enterprise and customer products. We built a small reporting and data section which collects and shows the app usage statistics to the company IT manager.

            <h1>The C factor</h1>

            <p>
                Cost of product development matters as much as the quality for an early stage startup. While we at Ajency.in don't believe in competing on price the dollar/pound cost arbitrage with the rupee and our lean and mean structure brings significant cost benefits
                to our clients. Before the Bekumo people discovered us over a game of golf with one of our long standing clients (the game does have its advantages) they had engaged a London based team. We built the first version of their Android and
                iOS app in as much money as what they spent in getting their branding done with the London based agency.
